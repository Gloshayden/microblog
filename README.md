# microblog
a microblog i made following the flask mega tutorial.

to run make a virtual environment (venv) with python3 -m venv venv 

then activate it using source venv/bin/activate (run venv/scripts/activate if on windows)

after that run flask db init, flask db migrate, flask db upgrade

after that you can run the app using flask run

(the github on the header links to my github you can replace/remove it by deleting it in base.html)
